## About the project

New Numpy-Matplotlib Examples is - as name suggests - a set
of exemplary programs exploring great capabilities of two fundamental
Python libraries: NumPy and Matplotlib.

Generally, in terms of third-party libraries, examples in these project
use ONLY these two packages (however, a few more packages need to be installed,
e.g. JupyterLab as the environment to present the code working, and ipympl
for Matplotlib to work in JupyterLab).

## Parts of the project

The project consists of the following parts:

1. **Basics** - notebooks with explanation of basics of NumPy and Matplotlib and
fundamental features presentation; materials from this part may well be used as
an introduction to these packages
2. **Neural network** - a framework to build and train neural networks, written in
pure NumPy, along with some experiments and visualizations

## How to run

1. Install packages:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run Jupyter Lab web environment:

```commandline
jupyter lab
```

3. In Jupyter Lab, navigate to the notebook you'd like to run.
