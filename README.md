## About the project

New Numpy-Matplotlib Examples is - as name suggests - a set
of exemplary programs exploring great capabilities of two fundamental
Python libraries: NumPy and Matplotlib.

Generally, in terms of third-party libraries, examples in these project
use ONLY these two packages (however, a few more packages need to be installed,
e.g. JupyterLab as the environment to present the code working, and ipympl
for Matplotlib to work in JupyterLab).
